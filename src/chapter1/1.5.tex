\section*{Exercise 1}

Analyze the logical forms of the following statements:

\noindent (a) If this gas either has an unpleasant smell or is not explosive, 
then it isn't hydrogen

$$(S \vee \neg E) \then \neg H$$

Where,

$S$ = Gas has an unpleasant smell,
$E$ = Gas is explosive,
$H$ = Gas is hydrogen.

\noindent (b) Having both a fever and a headache is a sufficient condition for 
George to go to the doctor

$$(F \wedge H) \then D$$

Where,

$F$ = George has a fever,
$H$ = George has a headache,
$D$ = George goes to the doctor.

\noindent (c) Both having a fever and having a headache are sufficient conditions
for George to go to the doctor.

$$(F \vee H) \then D$$

\noindent (d) If $x \neq 2$, then a necessary condition for $x$ to be prime is that
$x$ be odd.

$$(x \neq 2) \then (P(x) \then O(x))$$

Where,

$P(x)$ is true when $x$ is prime,
$O(x)$ is true when $x$ is odd.

\section*{Exercise 2}

Analyze the logical forms of the following statements:

\noindent (a) Mary will sell her house only if she can get a good price and find a
nice apartment.

$$H \then P \wedge A$$

Where,
$H$ = Mary will sell her house,
$P$ = Mary will get a good price,
$A$ = Mary will find a nice apartment.

\noindent (b) Having both a good credit history and an adequate down payment is a
necessary condition for getting a mortgage.

$$M \then (C \wedge D)$$

$C$ = Having good credit history,
$D$ = Having adequate down payment,
$M$ = Getting mortgage.

\noindent (c) John will drop out of school, unless someone stops him

If John is stopped, he will not drop out of school. If John is not stopped, then 
he will drop out of school

$$\neg S \ifonly D$$

Where,
$S$ is stops John,
$D$ is John drops out of school.

\noindent (d) If x is divisible by either 4 or 6, then it isn't prime.

$$D(x, 4) \vee D(x, 6) \then \neg P(x)$$

\noindent Analyze the logical form of the following statement:


\noindent (a) If it is raining, then it is windy and the sun is not shining.
Now analyze the following statements. Also, for each statement determine
whether the statement is equivalent to either statement (a) or its converse.

$$R \then W \wedge \neg S$$

Where,
$R$ is it is raining,
$W$ is it is windy,
$S$ is sun is shining

\noindent (b) It is windy and not sunny only if it is raining.

$$W \wedge \neg S \then R$$

Converse of (a)

\noindent (c) Rain is a sufficient condition for wind with no sunshine.

$$R \then W \wedge \neg S$$

Equivalent to (a)

\noindent (d) Rain is a necessary condition for wind with no sunshine.

$$W \wedge \neg S \then R$$

Converse of (a)

\noindent (e) It's not raining, if either the sun is shining or it's not windy.

$$S \vee \neg W \then \neg R$$

Equivalent to (a)

\noindent (f) Wind is a necessary condition for it to be rainy, and so is a lack of
sunshine.

$$(R \then W) \wedge (R \then \neg S)$$ % TODOL: proof

Equivalent to (a)

\noindent (g) Either it is windy only if it is raining, or it is not sunny only if it is
raining.

$$(W \then R) \vee (\neg S \then R)$$ % TODO: proof

Converse of (a)
