# How to Prove It: A Structured Approach

Solutions to (hopefully soon) all of the problems in "How to Prove it" by Daniel J. Velleman, 3rd Edition, ISBN 978-1-108-43953-4

I've seen many for the first and second edition, but a very clean set of solutions in `LaTeX` with the 3rd edition doesn't seem to exist yet

# Notes

This is written using `LaTeX`, it can be easily compiled with

`pdflatex tex_filename`

These problems take a very long time to solve and type up. I greatly appreciate any help solving, typing or proof reading these documents
